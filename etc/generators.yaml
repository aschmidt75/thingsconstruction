   shortdesc: Arduino-compatible JSON/REST-API, for use with EthernetServer
   desc: "This generates a single .ino sketch suitable for working with the Arduino IDE. The sketch
   will run an HTTP server, which serves the Web Of Things API. Understands JSON.
   Setup-Code includes code to connect via an Ethernet Adapter. Will run on probably
   most hardware that supports the Arduino Framework and an Ethernet Shield."
